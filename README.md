# Torch Rain
Library for rain estimation and detection built with pytorch. 
This library provide an implementations of algorithms for extracting rain-rate using data from commercial microwave links (CMLs). Addinaly this project provide an example dataset with data from two CMLs and implementation of perfomance and robustness metrics.  

# Install


# Projects Structer

1. Wet Dry Classification
2. Baseline - Done
3. Power Law - Done
4. Rain estimation
5. Metrics
6. Robutness

# Dataset

# Examples
 
* Rain estimation using dynamic baseline []
* Rain estimation using constant baseline []
* Wet Dry Classification using statistic test []

# Model Zoo
In this project we supply a set of trained networks in our [Model Zoo](https://github.com/haihabi/torch_rain/blob/master/model_zoo/model_zoo.md), this networks are trained on our own dataset which is not publicly available.

# TODO
1. Create dataset
2. Generate model-driven example
3. Built Model Zoo
4. Present Example of model zoo
