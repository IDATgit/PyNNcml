# Torch Rain
Library for rain estimation and detection built with pytorch. 
This library provide an implementations of algorithms for extracting rain-rate using data from commercial microwave links (CMLs). Addinaly this project provide an example dataset with data from two CMLs and implementation of perfomance and robustness metrics.
